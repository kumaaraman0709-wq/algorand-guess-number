# ðŸ”¢ Guess Number dApp on Algorand

Welcome to **Guess Number**, a simple and fun decentralized application (dApp) built on the Algorand blockchain. This project demonstrates how to build interactive smart contracts using TypeScript and Algorandâ€™s secure and scalable infrastructure.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description

**Guess Number** is a smart contract-based game where users try to guess a secret number stored on-chain. Itâ€™s designed to be simple enough for beginners, yet practical enough to demonstrate real-world smart contract usage on Algorand.

This project is great for developers exploring Algorand, learning about global state, or wanting to build gamified blockchain experiences.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Stores a secret number in the smart contract's global state.
- Accepts a userâ€™s guess as input.
- Compares the guess to the secret number.
- Returns one of the following responses:
  - âœ… `"correct"` â€” if the guess matches the secret
  - ðŸ”¼ `"too high"` â€” if the guess is greater than the secret
  - ðŸ”½ `"too low"` â€” if the guess is less than the secret

---

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ§  **On-Chain Logic**: All validation is done by the smart contract.
- âš¡ **Fast & Efficient**: Powered by Algorand's high-speed network and low fees.
- ðŸ’¬ **Immediate Feedback**: Players get a response instantly after guessing.
- ðŸ§± **TypeScript Smart Contract**: Built using the modern `@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript` framework.
- ðŸ“š **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear, simple logic perfect for learning and experimenting.

## ðŸ§  Smart Contract Code

Hereâ€™s the smart contract that powers the game:

```ts


import { Contract, GlobalState, uint64 } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class GuessNumber extends Contract {
  secret = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "secret", initialValue: 7 })

  guess(num: uint64): string {
    if (num === this.secret.value) return "correct"
    return num > this.secret.value ? "too high" : "too low"
  }
}
